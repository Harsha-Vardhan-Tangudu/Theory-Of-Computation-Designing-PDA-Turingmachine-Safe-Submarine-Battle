# Safe Submarine Battle

This project focuses on analyzing the outcome of a submarine's journey under two different conditions: reaching the base safely without engaging in a battle, and reaching the base safely after participating in a battle.

## Problem Statement

The objective is to thoroughly examine both scenarios, considering factors such as missile status, equipment effectiveness, and potential threats encountered during the battle. By conducting a comprehensive analysis, the project aims to gain insights into the effectiveness of different approaches in ensuring the submarine's safe arrival at the base, regardless of whether combat engagement took place.

## Introduction

Before a submarine enters the water, a detailed procedure needs to be followed, including missile loading, fuel level checking, surface water check, ballet filling, and equipment verification. Once in the water, the submarine goes through various states such as lost state, submarine reconnaissance, practicing defensive maneuvers, and sonar locking mode, with the ultimate goal of reaching the post-dive state.

## Goal of the Project

The goal of this project is to analyze the submarine's journey in two different conditions and evaluate the effectiveness of different approaches in ensuring its safe arrival at the base. The project considers factors such as missile count, fuel checking, equipment effectiveness, and encounters during battles. By conducting a comprehensive analysis, the project aims to provide insights into the effectiveness of different strategies in submarine operations.

## Pushdown Automata and Turing Machine

The project involves the use of Pushdown Automata (PDA) and Turing Machine (TM) to model and analyze the submarine's journey. The PDA is used to represent the states, transitions, and stack operations, while the TM is used to convert the PDA scenario into a tape-based scenario with modified transitions.
